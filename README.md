gatewayd-installers
===================

Thoroughly tested installation scripts for gatewayd et al. Based on wiki and documentation already available. Goal: to produce 100% copy-paste-executable commands that a minimally trained chimpanzee could use to set up a functioning ripple gateway. Provides:
  - Gatewayd
  - Ripple-Rest
  - Postgresql
  - Automates configuration to a large extent, including password generation and startup script creation. WALLET ADDRESSES ARE EXAMPLES. Commands to generate your own wallets are included.

These instructions *should* work for any Ubuntu distro >= 12.04, but we have only tested on Ubuntu Server 14.04.1 and Kubuntu 12.04.5.
